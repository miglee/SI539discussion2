    <h1>Hi! This is Mig.</h1>

<img src="images/indeximage.jpg" alt = "UX components"/>

<p>I always ask "why"s behind routines and seek for better solutions.
I'm a UX designer who finds insights and makes simple and distinguished design.
</p>

<p>Currently, I’m studying in the HCI program of University of Michigan, specialized in UX design and research. I’m seeking full time UX design position after graduating in May 2019.
Please contact me if you’reinterested in working with me!
